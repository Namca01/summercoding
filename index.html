            Nearly destroyed during China’s Cultural Revolution, Yumbhulhagang became a symbol of the broader effort to erase Tibet’s cultural and spiritual heritage following the 1950 occupation. Though later rebuilt, it remains a powerful reminder of the Tibetan people's deep connection to their land and the enduring strength of their identity.

            <h2>⛰️ Dharamsala</h2> 
            <p> After fleeing into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lama established the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. Though outside Tibet’s borders, Dharamsala has become a third symbolic capital — a refuge where culture, language, and faith continue to flourish against all odds. </p> <p> From this hillside town, generations of Tibetans in exile have preserved their identity, taught their history, and sustained a vision of return. Dharamsala stands as a global reminder that while Tibet’s land may be occupied, its spirit remains unbroken. </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet’s historical journey reflects a profound evolution — from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet’s political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond — to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
